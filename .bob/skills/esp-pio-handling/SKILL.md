  Complete PlatformIO lifecycle: build, upload, and monitor ESP32 firmware.
  Automatically detects whether a workbench is available or the device is
  connected locally via USB. Covers platformio.ini configuration, RFC2217

  Triggers on "pio", "platformio", "pio run", "pio upload", "platformio.ini".

# PlatformIO Handling

Complete lifecycle for PlatformIO ESP32 projects — build, upload, and monitor.
Automatically adapts to local USB or remote workbench.

## Step 1: Detect Environment

Determine whether a workbench is available or the device is local.

```bash
curl -s http://workbench.local:8080/api/info
```

- **Response received** → workbench available, use RFC2217 remote upload
- **Connection refused / timeout** → try the discovery script:
  ```bash
  sudo python3 .claude/skills/esp-pio-handling/discover-workbench.py --hosts
  ```
- **Still no response** → no workbench, use local USB upload

## Step 2: Build

```bash
pio run                    # Build default environment
pio run -e esp32dev        # Build specific environment
pio run -t clean           # Clean build
```

If there are multiple environments in `platformio.ini`, ask which one to build
or build all.

After build:
- Parse any compilation errors, map to source files, suggest fixes
- On success, show firmware size (RAM/Flash usage)
- Check for missing libraries in `lib_deps`

## Step 3a: Upload — Local USB

When the device is connected directly via USB.

```bash
pio device list                         # Find connected devices
pio run -t upload                       # Upload to default environment
pio run -e esp32dev -t upload           # Upload to specific environment
pio device monitor                      # Open serial monitor
pio run -t upload && pio device monitor # Upload and monitor
```

## Step 3b: Upload — Workbench (RFC2217)

When a workbench is available. Check the portal for slot-to-port assignments:

```bash
curl -s http://workbench.local:8080/api/devices | jq '.slots[] | {label, url, state}'
```

### Configure platformio.ini

```ini
upload_port = rfc2217://workbench.local:4001monitor_port = rfc2217://workbench.local:4001```

### Or via command line

```bash
pio run -t upload --upload-port 'rfc2217://workbench.local:4001?ign_set_control'
pio device monitor --port 'rfc2217://workbench.local:4001?ign_set_control'
```

## Step 4: Monitor

```bash
# Local
pio device monitor

# Workbench — via RFC2217
pio device monitor --port 'rfc2217://workbench.local:4001?ign_set_control'

# Workbench — via UDP logs (non-blocking)
curl "http://workbench.local:8080/api/udplog?limit=50"
```

## Boot Mode

If upload fails, put ESP32 in bootloader mode:
1. Hold **BOOT** button
2. Press **RESET** button
3. Release **RESET**, then **BOOT**

## Troubleshooting

### Local USB

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No device found | Check USB cable, `pio device list` |
| Permission denied | `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER`, re-login |
| Upload timeout | Enter boot mode (BOOT+RESET sequence) |

### Workbench (RFC2217)

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Connection refused | Check portal at `http://workbench.local:8080`; verify device state is `idle` |
| Timeout during flash | Use `--no-stub` flag; check network |
| Port busy | Close other terminal/tool using the same RFC2217 port |
